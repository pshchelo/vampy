  abstract = {A time-dependent set of line scans across an erythrocyte was recorded
	by a phase contrast laser scanning microscope. A method for edge
	detection, based on a two-stage fitting procedure of the theoretical
	intensity distribution in a line scan of phase contrast image to
	the experimental one, is suggested. Time-resolved fluctuations of
	the human erythrocyte's edge were obtained, employing this method.
	The same procedure was carried out for a metallic strip yielding
	a test for the background noise level. The suggested method was applied
	in examining the effect of chemical crosslinking and thiol reduction
	on cell membrane fluctuations of human erythrocytes.},

  abstract = {We evaluate the effective Hamiltonian governing, at the optically
	resolved scale, the elastic properties of micromanipulated membranes.
	We identify floppy, entropic-tense and stretched-tense regimes, representing
	different behaviors of the effective-area elasticity of the membrane.
	The corresponding effective tension depends on the microscopic parameters
	(total area, bending rigidity) and on the optically visible area,
	which is controlled by the imposed external constraints. We successfully
	compare our predictions with recent data on micropipette experiments.},

  journal = {The European Physical Journal E - Soft Matter},
  year = {2004},
  volume = {14},
  pages = {149--167},
  number = {2},
  month = jun,
  abstract = {The classical micro-pipette aspiration technique, applied for measuring
	the membrane bending elasticity, is in the present work reviewed
	and extended to span the range of pipette aspiration pressures going
	through the flaccid (low pressures) to tense (high pressures) membrane
	regime. The quality of the conventional methods for analysing data
	is evaluated using numerically generated data and a new method for
	data analysis, based on thermodynamic analysis and detailed statistical
	mechanical modelling, is introduced. The analysis of the classical
	method, where the membrane bending modulus is obtained from micro-pipette
	aspiration data acquired in the low-pressure regime, reveals a significant
	correction from membrane stretching elasticity. The new description,
	which includes the full vesicle geometry and both the membrane bending
	and stretching elasticity, is used for the interpretation of micro-pipette
	aspiration experiments conducted on SOPC (stearoyl-oleoyl-phosphatidyl-choline)
	lipid vesicles in the fluid phase. The data analysis, which is extended
	by detailed image analysis and a fitting procedure based on Monte
	Carlo integration, gives an estimate of the bending modulus, that
	agrees with previously published results obtained by the use of shape
	fluctuation analysis of giant unilamellar vesicles. The obtained
	estimate of the area expansion modulus, is automatically corrected
	for contributions from residual thermal undulations and the equilibrium
	area of the vesicle is resolved.},

  abstract = {In attempting to analyze, on digitaI computers, data from basicaIIy
	continuous physical experiments, numerical methods of performing
	familiar operations must be developed. The operations of differentiation
	and filtering are especially important both as an end in themselves,
	and as a prelude to further treatment of the data. Numerical counterparts
	of analog devices that perform these operations, such as RC filters,
	are often considered. However, the method of least squares may be
	used without additional computational complexity and with considerable
	improvement in the informotion obtained. The least squares calculations
	may be carried out in the computer by convolution of the data points
	with properly chosen sets of integers. These sets of integers and
	their normalizing factors are described and their use is illustrated
	in spectroscopic applications. The computer programs required are
	relatively simple. Two examples are presented as subroutines in the
	FORTRAN language.},

  abstract = {Some years ago, Savitzky and Golay (1) proposed a series of numerical
	tables for the smoothing of experimental data and for the computation
	of their derivatives. The main advantage of the method is that they
	obtain universal numerical functions, the convolution of which with
	the original vector data gives a smoothed vector as well as its successive
	derivatives.
	
	Unfortunately the published tables seem t o include some numerical
	errors. Moreover, Equation IIIc in (1) fails in the case i = k =
	r = 0 since it does not give the identification b,n,o = yo as it
	follows from Equation IIIa. The correct equation is written and the
	tables were recalculated by introducing this correction in Savitzky
	and Golay’s reasoning and a check was performed by using a more general
	matrician formalism.},
